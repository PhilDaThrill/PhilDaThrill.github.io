Say you had to spend the rest of your days stranded on a desert island, but you were allowed to take a single reverb plugin with you. Which one would you choose? Most (sane) people would say none at all, because let's face it - what good would a reverb plugin do in that situation? Not very much of course. However, that didn't stop us from giving it our all so that one day, some people might answer this question with "PhiVerb".

## Design Goals

This was our primary design goal - to make PhiVerb capable of being your desert island reverb. We did this by giving it four modes with four distinct algorithms, each of which could warrant its own plugin. Together, they do an excellent job of covering all the reverb essentials.

In terms of sound, the goal was to achieve a combination of realism and clarity that can match the very best. This was done using using recent advancements in technology and modern algorithms, each of which was crafted to faithfully recreate the space or medium that it is aims to emulate.

Last but not least, our aim was to provide PhiVerb with an extensive list of features, resulting in perhaps one of the most complete reverb plugins you will ever come across.

## Modes
But first, let's take a look at the four modes, which are

- **Hall:** Clearly distinguishable and natural early reflections (especially with the "Size" knob turned up), which gradually fade into a tail as smooth as that of a unicorn. Hall mode has a rather dark tone, which serves well in achieving epic moods. This can of course be adjusted with the tilt knob if necessary.
- **Room:** Early reflections that are barely discernable and practically one with the tail - just like in a real room. Has a bit of a lighter tone when compared to the Hall setting. This will often be the first choice for giving a recording or mix a natural feeling of space.
- **Plate:** Just like the original, this algorithm exhibits a practically immediate buildup of reverb density and an exceptionally silky tone. It is modeled after the famous plate reverb that you find in many classic studio recordings. The heart of this algorithm actually contains a sliver of an impulse response taken from an actual EMT 140 plate reverb.
- **Air:** We consider this mode somewhat of a secret weapon. It is for when you want a sense of space, but you also don't really want any identifiable reverb tails. The "Room" mode can certainly conveigh this sense of space, but it some situation this may be too much of a good thing. Hence the "Air" mode, which is a lot more subtle. In doing so, it makes pretty much anything sound better - especially if you have a rather dry sound to begin with.

##  Features
PhiVerb comes with a fully laden feature pallet. It contains
- **Extensive sound shaping capabilities:** Aside from the usual high cut and low cut options, PhiVerb also offers a 
convenient way of altering the tone of the reverb using the "Tilt" parameter. It tilts the entire frequency spectrum to one side or the other, allowing you to go from a boomingly dark to a sparklingly light tone with a single twist of a knob.
- **Integrated ducking:** Make the reverb "duck" under the original signal. This is useful for when you want to preserve the clarity of the tone without sacrificing those sweet reverb tails. Often used on pop vocals. This is usually achieved using side-chaining, but with PhiVerb it is always at your fingertips.
- **Help Mode:** PhiVerb is self-documenting. Not sure what a knob does? Activate "Help Mode" and let comprehensive and informative tooltips come to the rescue.
- **Presets:** Let our intrically designed factory presets provide you with a good starting point - or save your own settings with a user preset.
- **Wide array of controls:** Alter the character of the reverb with the "Shape", "Damping", and "Modulation" controls.
- **Infinity mode:** Create never-ending soundscapes or sustain a sound indefinately - featured in Hall and Plate modes by turning up the "Decay" knob all the way.
