## Step 1: Download the installer

Phiverb is compatable with all of the most common system-, architecture- and format combinations.

### Windows Installer

{{< rawhtml >}}
<table class="container mt-2 mb-3">
  <tr class="row justify-content-center mb-3">
    <th class="col-5">
        <a href="/downloads/PhiVerbInstaller_Win64.exe" download class="btn btn-primary custom-button">Download PhiVerb Windows Installer</a>
    </th>
  </tr>
  <tr class="row">
    <td class="col"><strong>Formats</strong></td>
    <td class="col">VST3, AAX</td>
  </tr>
  <tr class="row">
    <td class="col"><strong>OS</strong></td>
    <td class="col">Windows 8+</td>
  </tr>
  <tr class="row">
    <td class="col"><strong>Architecture</strong></td>
    <td class="col">64 bit</td>
  </tr>
</table>
{{< /rawhtml >}}

For 32-bit Windows systems, grab your legacy installer [here](/downloads/PhiVerbInstaller_Win32.exe).

### MacOS Installer

{{< rawhtml >}}
<table class="container mt-2 mb-3">
  <tr class="row justify-content-center mb-3">
    <th class="col-5">
        <a href="/downloads/PhiVerbInstaller_Mac.dmg" download class="btn btn-primary custom-button">Download PhiVerb MacOS Installer</a>
    </th>
  </tr>
  <tr class="row">
    <td class="col"><strong>Formats</strong></td>
    <td class="col">VST3, AU, AAX</td>
  </tr>
  <tr class="row">
    <td class="col"><strong>OS</strong></td>
    <td class="col">MacOS 10.13+</td>
  </tr>
  <tr class="row">
    <td class="col"><strong>Architecture</strong></td>
    <td class="col">Supports both Intel and Apple Silicon</td>
  </tr>
</table>
{{< /rawhtml >}}

Now that we have that out of the way, let’s see how we can get PhiVerb up and running.

## Step 2: Follow through the installation process

Click on the installer and let yourself be guided through the process. This installer will do two things:
 
- It will copy the plugin files to the locations where your DAW will find them.
- It will create the resource folder containing factory presets. This will later also hold the licensing file.

## Step 3: Activate PhiVerb in your DAW

To activate PhiVerb, simply launch your DAW of choice and locate PhiVerb in it. It may be listed under the “Others” section of your plugins. The first time when opening PhiVerb, a login field will appear. Here, enter the credentials that have been provided to you. The plugin will then contact our licensing server for validation. This is the only point where PhiVerb requires internet access. After that, you are good to go!

Note: In rare cases, some DAWs won’t let you type in the “@” symbol (looking at you, Reaper). In that case, you can also type “&lt;at&gt;” instead.
